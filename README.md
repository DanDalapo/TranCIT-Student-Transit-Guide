TranCIT - Student Transit Guide
Project Overview
TranCIT - Student Transit Guide is a mobile-responsive web application meticulously designed to revolutionize the commuting experience for students in Cebu City. It specifically targets freshmen, transferees, and non-local students who often find themselves unfamiliar with the intricacies of the local Public Utility Jeepney (PUJ) system. Our mission is to transform a typically complex and anxiety-inducing daily task into a straightforward, efficient, and stress-free journey.
Problem Solved
Navigating Cebu's jeepney system presents significant challenges due to its alphanumeric route codes (e.g., 13C, 04L), reliance on informal landmark-based directions, and the scarcity of comprehensive, accurate digital mapping tools. This often leads to students getting lost, taking inefficient routes, overpaying for fares, and experiencing undue stress and safety concerns.
Key Features
The Student Transit Guide provides a robust set of tools to address these issues:
Route Finder: Generates clear, step-by-step jeepney commute instructions between any specified origin and destination within Cebu City.
Jeepney Code Translator: A searchable database that deciphers local jeepney route shorthand, explaining what codes like "13C" signify.
Fare Estimator: An automated calculator providing accurate estimated jeepney fares based on the generated route and distance.
Landmark-Based Navigation: Integrates prominent city landmarks into directions for intuitive and easier wayfinding.
Newbie Mode: Offers a simplified interface with more detailed, beginner-friendly instructions, perfect for first-time commuters.
Offline Route Saving: Allows users to save generated routes for access even without an active internet connection.
Technology Stack
Built with modern web technologies to ensure a smooth and reliable user experience:
Frontend: React (JavaScript framework) with Leaflet.js for interactive mapping.
Backend API: Python with the Django framework.
Database: PostgreSQL.
Mapping Services: Mapbox API.
